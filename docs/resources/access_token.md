# Artifactory Access Token Resource

Provides an Artifactory Access Token resource. This can be used to create and manage Artifactory Access Tokens.

~> **Note:** Access Tokens will be stored in the raw state as plain-text. [Read more about sensitive data in
state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).


## Example Usages
### Create a new Artifactory Access Token for an existing user

```hcl
resource "artifactory_access_token" "exising_user" {
  username          = "existing-user"
  end_date_relative = "5m"
}
```

Note: This assumes that the user `existing-user` has already been created in Artifactory by different means, i.e. manually or in a separate terraform apply.

### Create a new Artifactory User and Access token
```hcl
resource "artifactory_user" "new_user" {
  name   = "new_user"
  email  = "new_user@somewhere.com"

  groups = [
    "readers",
  ]
}

resource "artifactory_access_token" "new_user" {
  username          = artifactory_user.new_user.name
  end_date_relative = "5m"
}
```

### Creates a new token for groups
This creates a transient user called `temporary-user`.
```hcl
resource "artifactory_access_token" "temporary_user" {
  username          = "temporary-user"
  end_date_relative = "1h"

  groups = [
    "readers",
  ]
}
```

### Create token with no expiry
```hcl
resource "artifactory_access_token" "no_expiry" {
  username          = "existing-user"
  end_date_relative = "0s"
}
```

### Creates a refreshable token
```hcl
resource "artifactory_access_token" "refreshable" {
  username          = "refreshable"
  end_date_relative = "1m"

  refreshable = true

  groups = [
    "readers",
  ]
}
```

### Creates an administrator token
```hcl
resource "artifactory_access_token" "admin" {
  username          = "admin"
  end_date_relative = "1m"

  admin_token {
    instance_id = "<instance id>"
  }
}
```

### Creates a token with an audience
```hcl
resource "artifactory_access_token" "audience" {
  username          = "audience"
  end_date_relative = "1m"

  audience = "jfrt@*"
  refreshable = true
}
```

### Creates a token with a fixed end date
```hcl
resource "artifactory_access_token" "fixeddate" {
  username = "fixeddate"
  end_date = "2018-01-01T01:02:03Z"

  groups = [
    "readers",
  ]
}
```

### Rotate token after it expires
This example will generate a token that will expire in 1 hour.

If `terraform apply` is run before 1 hour, nothing changes.
One an hour has passed, `terraform apply` will generate a new token.

```hcl
resource "time_rotating" "now_plus_1_hours" {
  rotation_hours = "1"
}

resource "artifactory_access_token" "rotating" {
  username = "rotating"

  # the end_date is set to now + 1 hours
  end_date = time_rotating.now_plus_1_hour.rotation_rfc3339

  groups = [
    "readers",
  ]
}
```

### Rotate token each terraform apply
This example will generate a token that will expire in 1 hour.

If `terraform apply` is run before 1 hour, a new token is generated with an expiry of 1 hour.

```hcl
resource "time_rotating" "now_plus_1_hours" {
  triggers  = {
    "key"   = timestamp()
  }

  rotation_hours = "1"
}

resource "artifactory_access_token" "rotating" {
  username = "rotating"

  # the end_date is set to now + 1 hours
  end_date = time_rotating.now_plus_1_hour.rotation_rfc3339

  groups = [
    "readers",
  ]
}
```

## Attribute Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `username` - (Required) The username or subject for the token. A non-admin can only specify their own username. Admins can specify any existing username, or a new name for a temporary token. Temporary tokens require `groups` to be set.

* One of `end_date` or `end_date_relative` must be set.

    * `end_date` - (Optional) The end date which the token is valid until, formatted as a RFC3339 date string (e.g. `2018-01-01T01:02:03Z`).

    * `end_date_relative` - (Optional) A relative duration for which the token is valid until, for example `240h` (10 days) or `2400h30m`. Valid time units are "s", "m", "h".

* `groups` - (Optional) List of groups. The token is granted access based on the permissions of the groups. Specify `["*"]` for all groups that the user belongs to. `groups` cannot be specified with `admin_token`.
* `admin_token` - (Optional) Specify the `instance_id` in this block to grant this token admin privileges. This can only be created when the authenticated user is an admin. `admin_token` cannot be specified with `groups`.
* `refreshable` - (Optional) Is this token refreshable? Defaults to `false`
* `audience` - (Optional) A space-separate list of the other Artifactory instances or services that should accept this token identified by their Artifactory Service IDs. You may set `"jfrt@*"` so the token to be accepted by all Artifactory instances.

  Refreshable must be `true` to set the `audience`. 
    
    For instructions to retrieve the Artifactory Service ID see this [documentation](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+REST+API#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-GetServiceID).

**Notes:**
- Changing **any** field forces a new resource to be created.
- Although you can create a refreshable token, by setting `refreshable` to true, the resource does **not** implement a token refresh on subsequent executions of Terraform.

The following additional attributes are exported:

* `access_token` - Returns the access token to authenciate to Artifactory
* `refresh_token` - Returns the refresh token when `refreshable` is true, or an empty string when `refreshable` is false.

## Import

Artifactory **does not** retain access tokens and cannot be imported into state.
