# Artifactory Backup Resource

This resource can be used to manage the automatic and periodic backups of the entire Artifactory instance.

When an `artifactory_backup` resource is configured and enabled to true, backup of the entire Artifactory system will be done automatically and periodically. 
The backup process creates a time-stamped directory in the target backup directory.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Configure Artifactory Backup system config
resource "artifactory_backup" "backup_config_name" {
  key                       = "backup_config_name"
  enabled                   = true
  cron_exp                  = "0 0 12 * * ?"
  retention_period_hours    = 1000
  excluded_repositories     = []
  create_archive            = false
  exclude_new_repositories  = true
  send_mail_on_error        = true
}
```
Note: `Key` argument has to match to the resource name.

* `cron_exp`                     - (Required) A valid CRON expression that you can use to control backup frequency. Eg: "0 0 12 * * ? ".
