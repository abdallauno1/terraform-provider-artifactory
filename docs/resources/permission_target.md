  name = "test-perm"

  repo {
    includes_pattern = ["foo/**"]
    excludes_pattern = ["bar/**"]
    repositories     = ["example-repo-local"]

    actions {
      users {
        name        = "anonymous"
        permissions = ["read", "write"]
      }

      groups {
        name        = "readers"
        permissions = ["read"]
      }
    }
  }

  build {
    includes_pattern = ["**"]
    repositories     = ["artifactory-build-info"]

    actions {
      users {
        name        = "anonymous"
        permissions = ["read", "write"]
      }
    }
  }

  release_bundle {
    includes_pattern = ["**"]
